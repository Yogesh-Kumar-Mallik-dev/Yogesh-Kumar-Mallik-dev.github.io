    <h2>Journey So Far</h2>
    <div class="timeline">

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2024 - Last Quater</span>
        <p>Started learning about <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.  
        This marked the beginning of my journey into web development and how the web really works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2025 — First Quater</span>
        <p>Dived deeper into <strong>CSS</strong> and began shifting focus toward <strong>functionality</strong> rather than only styling.  
        Learned how to make things interactive, dynamic, and useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2025 — Second Quater</span>
        <p>Explored <strong>basic game design concepts</strong> and learned the <strong>working of game engines</strong>,  
        preparing myself for the next phase of becoming a game developer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2025 — Third Quater</span>
        <p><strong>Founded QiForge</strong> — not just to learn for myself, but to lead others.  
        Built it with a vision to grow despite limitations, and to create a space for self-driven innovation and learning.</p>

  <h2>About QiForge</h2>

  <div class="qiforge-container">
    <div class="qiforge-text">
      <p>
        <strong>QiForge</strong> is an independent student-driven tech initiative I founded in 2025.  
        It began as a small group with one goal — to learn, build, and grow beyond the limitations of the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organization focuses on <strong>collaboration, mentorship, and real-world projects</strong>.  
        Our sub-teams — <strong>Code Lead</strong> and <strong>Code Falcon</strong> — work on web systems, management dashboards,  
        and creative experiments that challenge how students learn technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        At QiForge, we believe in forging ideas into reality — not by following the environment,  
        but by creating our own path despite it.
