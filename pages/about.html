    <h2>Journey So Far</h2>
    <div class="timeline">

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2024</span>
        <p>Started learning about <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.  
        This marked the beginning of my journey into web development and how the web really works.</p>

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2025 â€” First Quater</span>
        <p>Dived deeper into <strong>CSS</strong> and began shifting focus toward <strong>functionality</strong> rather than only styling.  
        Learned how to make things interactive, dynamic, and useful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
        <span class="year">2025 â€” Second Quater</span>
